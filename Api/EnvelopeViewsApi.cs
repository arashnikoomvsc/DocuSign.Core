If the recipient is a signer, then the view will provide the signing ceremony.  ###### Note: Please redirect the client to the URL. iFrames should not be used, especially if the recipient may be using a mobile or tablet.   This method is only used with envelopes in the &#x60;sent&#x60; status.  Your application is responsible for authenticating the identity of the recipient or signer when you use this method. Use the parameters &#x60;assertionId&#x60;, &#x60;authenticationInstant&#x60;, &#x60;authenticationMethod&#x60;, &#x60;clientUserId&#x60;, and &#x60;securityDomain&#x60; to record information on how the recipient was authenticated. At a minimum, &#x60;authenticationMethod&#x60; and &#x60;clientUserId&#x60; are required. The information that you provide is included in the envelope&#39;s certificate of completion.  ## The event status parameter After the signer completes or ends the signing ceremony, DocuSign will redirect the user&#39;s browser back to your app via the &#x60;returnUrl&#x60; that you supply. DocuSIgn appends an &#x60;event&#x60; query parameter to the URL with the outcome of the signing ceremony. Your app should use the event parameter to determine the next step for the envelope. Don&#39;t fetch the envelope&#39;s status via Envelopes: get or a similar method; that could break the DocuSign rule against polling.  ## The URL is time-limited The URL returned by this method is valid for one use. It must be used/displayed within a couple of minutes after being generated. Once the recipient is redirected to the recipient view, they must interact with the DocuSign system periodically or their session will time out.  Because the URL is time-limited, it should not be stored or sent via email. Immediately redirect the user&#39;s browser to the URL after you receive it.  If you want to invite someone to an embedded signing session via email, the email invitation&#39;s URL must be to your application. When invoked, your app should request a recipientView URL from DocuSign and then redirect the signer to that URL.  ## Maintaining State After the recipient completes the recipient view (or signing ceremony), they are redirected to your application. Your application can recover state information about the transaction by storing information in a cookie, or by including query parameters in the &#x60;returnUrl&#x60; field. Eg, &#x60;https://myapp.eg.com/docusign_return?myState&#x3D;12345&#x60; When the user is redirected to your app, the &#x60;event&#x60; query parameter will be appended. In this example, prevent spoofing by not using a guessable value as the state value.

        /// Returns a URL that enables you to embed the recipient view of the DocuSign UI in your applications. If the recipient is a signer, then the view will provide the signing ceremony.  ###### Note: Please redirect the client to the URL. iFrames should not be used, especially if the recipient may be using a mobile or tablet.   This method is only used with envelopes in the &#x60;sent&#x60; status.  Your application is responsible for authenticating the identity of the recipient or signer when you use this method. Use the parameters &#x60;assertionId&#x60;, &#x60;authenticationInstant&#x60;, &#x60;authenticationMethod&#x60;, &#x60;clientUserId&#x60;, and &#x60;securityDomain&#x60; to record information on how the recipient was authenticated. At a minimum, &#x60;authenticationMethod&#x60; and &#x60;clientUserId&#x60; are required. The information that you provide is included in the envelope&#39;s certificate of completion.  ## The event status parameter After the signer completes or ends the signing ceremony, DocuSign will redirect the user&#39;s browser back to your app via the &#x60;returnUrl&#x60; that you supply. DocuSIgn appends an &#x60;event&#x60; query parameter to the URL with the outcome of the signing ceremony. Your app should use the event parameter to determine the next step for the envelope. Don&#39;t fetch the envelope&#39;s status via Envelopes: get or a similar method; that could break the DocuSign rule against polling.  ## The URL is time-limited The URL returned by this method is valid for one use. It must be used/displayed within a couple of minutes after being generated. Once the recipient is redirected to the recipient view, they must interact with the DocuSign system periodically or their session will time out.  Because the URL is time-limited, it should not be stored or sent via email. Immediately redirect the user&#39;s browser to the URL after you receive it.  If you want to invite someone to an embedded signing session via email, the email invitation&#39;s URL must be to your application. When invoked, your app should request a recipientView URL from DocuSign and then redirect the signer to that URL.  ## Maintaining State After the recipient completes the recipient view (or signing ceremony), they are redirected to your application. Your application can recover state information about the transaction by storing information in a cookie, or by including query parameters in the &#x60;returnUrl&#x60; field. Eg, &#x60;https://myapp.eg.com/docusign_return?myState&#x3D;12345&#x60; When the user is redirected to your app, the &#x60;event&#x60; query parameter will be appended.

At a minimum, &#x60;authenticationMethod&#x60; and &#x60;clientUserId&#x60; are required. The information that you provide is included in the envelope&#39;s certificate of completion.  ## The event status parameter After the signer completes or ends the signing ceremony, DocuSign will redirect the user&#39;s browser back to your app via the &#x60;returnUrl&#x60; that you supply. DocuSIgn appends an &#x60;event&#x60; query parameter to the URL with the outcome of the signing ceremony. Your app should use the event parameter to determine the next step for the envelope. Don&#39;t fetch the envelope&#39;s status via Envelopes: get or a similar method; that could break the DocuSign rule against polling.  ## The URL is time-limited The URL returned by this method is valid for one use. It must be used/displayed within a couple of minutes after being generated. Once the recipient is redirected to the recipient view, they must interact with the DocuSign system periodically or their session will time out.  Because the URL is time-limited, it should not be stored or sent via email. Immediately redirect the user&#39;s browser to the URL after you receive it.  If you want to invite someone to an embedded signing session via email, the email invitation&#39;s URL must be to your application. When invoked, your app should request a recipientView URL from DocuSign and then redirect the signer to that URL.  ## Maintaining State After the recipient completes the recipient view (or signing ceremony), they are redirected to your application. Your application can recover state information about the transaction by storing information in a cookie, or by including query parameters in the &#x60;returnUrl&#x60; field. Eg, &#x60;https://myapp.eg.com/docusign_return?myState&#x3D;12345&#x60; When the user is redirected to your app, the &#x60;event&#x60; query parameter will be appended. In this example, prevent spoofing by not using a guessable value as the state value.
