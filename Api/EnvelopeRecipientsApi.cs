For an in process envelope, one that has been sent and has not been completed or voided, an email is sent to a new recipient when they are reached in the routing order. If the new recipient&#39;s routing order is before or the same as the envelope&#39;s next recipient, an email is only sent if the optional &#x60;resend_envelope&#x60; query string is set to **true**.
